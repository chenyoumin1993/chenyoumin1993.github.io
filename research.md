With the burgeoning demand for real-time data processing, the imperative to construct large-scale memory storage systems 
has become paramount. In light of this, the data center infrastructure is actively exploring innovative storage and network 
technologies, exemplified by byte-addressable non-volatile memory from Intel (e.g., Optane) and Samsung (CMM-H), and high-speed 
RDMA interconnections.

My research focus on developing efficient and robust next-generation storage systems utilizing these 
new hardware devices. I follow three fundamental design principles – CPU-awareness, device-awareness, and workload-awareness – 
essential for achieving optimal device bandwidth utilization, minimal CPU overhead, and predictable high performance.
