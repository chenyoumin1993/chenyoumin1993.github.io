<h2>About Me</h2>

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify;"> -->
I am a tenure-track associate professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), 
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am also a member of the [Data Driven Software Technology (DDST) Lab](https://ddst.sjtu.edu.cn/).
I build fast and robust next-gen data and storage systems with the generic goal of 
high device bandwidth utilization, low CPU cost, and high and predictable performance.
I also aim to leverage my expertise to construct innovative systems tailored to broader contexts, 
such as memory disaggregation and AI storage.
My work has appeared at top systems venues such as FAST, SOSP, ASPLOS, Eurosys, USENIX ATC, SIGMOD, VLDB, etc.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (advised by [Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu) 
and [Youyou Lu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lu)), and Bachelor
degree from [Honors College (formerly School of Advanced 
Engineering)](http://hc.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn).
I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University from 2021 to 2024, and as a 
visiting scholar at [ADSL](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/), UW-Madison from 2019 to 2020,  
advised by Prof. [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and 
[Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/).
