<h2>About Me</h2>


I am a tenure-track associate professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), 
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am also a member of the [Data Driven Software Technology (DDST) Lab](https://ddst.sjtu.edu.cn/).
I build fast and robust next-gen data and storage systems.
My work has appeared at top systems venues such as SOSP, FAST, ASPLOS, Eurosys, USENIX ATC, SIGMOD, VLDB, etc.
My current research interests lie at the intersection of storage systems and the following three disciplines:

- **Storage &times; OS**: **New abstractions** at the OS level with enhanced flexibility, programmability, and schedulability.

- **Storage &times; H/W**: **New systems** that enable faster interactions between emerging hardware and storage software.

- **Storage &times; AI**: **New applications** (e.g., large language models) through algorithm–storage co-design.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, advised by ([Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu) 
and [Youyou Lu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lu)), and Bachelor’s degree from [Honors College (formerly School of Advanced 
Engineering)](http://hc.buaa.edu.cn/), at [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn). From 2021 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University. Earlier, from 2019 to 2020, I was a visiting scholar in the ADSL lab at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, working with Professors [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and [Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/).
