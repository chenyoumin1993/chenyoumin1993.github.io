<h2>About Me</h2>


I am a tenure-track associate professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), 
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am also a member of the [Data Driven Software Technology (DDST) Lab](https://ddst.sjtu.edu.cn/).
I build fast and robust next-gen data and storage systems.
My work has appeared at top systems venues such as SOSP, FAST, ASPLOS, Eurosys, USENIX ATC, SIGMOD, VLDB, etc.
My current research interests lie at the intersection of storage systems and the following three disciplines:

- **Storage &times; OS**: Developing **new abstractions** at the operating system level to improve flexibility, programmability, and schedulability.

- **Storage &times; H/W**: Designing **new systems** that enable faster and more efficient interactions between emerging hardware and storage software.

- **Storage &times; AI**: Exploring **new applications** (e.g., large language models) through algorithm–storage co-design.



I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (advised by [Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu) 
and [Youyou Lu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lu)), and Bachelor
degree from [Honors College (formerly School of Advanced 
Engineering)](http://hc.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn).
I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University from 2021 to 2024, and as a 
visiting scholar at [ADSL](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/), UW-Madison from 2019 to 2020, advised by Prof. [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and [Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/).
