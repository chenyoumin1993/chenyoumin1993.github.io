<h2>About Me</h2>

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify;"> -->
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with [the Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), 
[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
I build fast and robust next-gen data and storage systems with the generic goal of 
high device bandwidth utilization, low CPU cost, and high and predictable performance.
I also aim to leverage my expertise to construct innovative systems tailored to broader contexts, 
such as memory disaggregation and AI storage.
My work has appeared at top systems venues such as FAST, ASPLOS, Eurosys, USENIX ATC, SIGMOD, VLDB, etc.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (advised by [Jiwu Shu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu) 
and [Youyou Lu](http://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lu)), and Bachelor
degree from [Honors College (formerly School of Advanced 
Engineering)](http://hc.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn).
During 2019 - 2020, I worked as a 
visiting scholar at [ADSL](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/), UW-Madison, 
advised by Prof. [Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and 
[Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/).
